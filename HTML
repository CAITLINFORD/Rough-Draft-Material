My HTML Knowledge

Let me write down before I forget some misc coding.
Let us begin.
!doctype
I might have written this wrong, but that is to state what type document

<p></p>
<p> This is a paragraph. This includes open arms and close arms. Its a common on. </p>
<h1></h1> 
<h1>This one is the main header and the bigger header. It goes from 1-6.</h1>
<br>
<br>If I remember correctly, it is br and its break. 
<br>It is breaking a phrase into a different line. 
<br>So you will need it for a hiku.
